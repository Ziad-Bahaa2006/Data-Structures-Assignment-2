## 📑 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Assignment Two** for the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course.  
The project includes solutions for triangular array operations, symmetric matrix compression, sorted array checking, and a circular queue implementation.  
All solutions were developed in **Java** following clean, readable, and well-structured coding practices.

## 📂 Contents

## **Part 1 — Triangular Arrays**

---

### 🔹 Exercise 1 — Display Upper & Lower Triangular Array
**Description:**  
Prints both **upper** and **lower** triangular parts of a square matrix.

**Topics Covered:**  
- Matrix traversal  
- Conditional element printing  
- Working with 2D arrays  

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2 — Store Symmetric Matrix in 1D Array
**Description:**  
Converts a symmetric 2D matrix into a 1D array by storing only one triangular part.

**Topics Covered:**  
- Symmetric matrices  
- Memory optimization  
- Index mapping (2D → 1D)  

---

### 🔹 Exercise 3 — Check if Array is Sorted (Recursive & Iterative)
**Description:**  
Implements two approaches to determine whether a given array is sorted:
- **Iterative** check  
- **Recursive** check  

**Topics Covered:**  
- Recursion  
- Iteration  
- Boolean evaluations  

---

## **Part 2 — Sequential Queues**

---

### 🔹 Exercise 4 — Circular Queue Implementation
**Description:**  
Implements a full **Circular Queue** using arrays.  
Supports:
- `enqueue`
- `dequeue`
- `display`

The program prints the queue contents after each modification.

**Topics Covered:**  
- Circular queues  
- Front/rear pointer logic  
- Handling overflow & underflow
